# Python String Manipulation Challenge

This challenge is designed to test your understanding of string manipulation in Python, specifically focusing on slicing, replacing, and function creation.

## Problem Statement

Given the following code snippet:

```python
my_string = 'This is a string that is being Printed'

Questions
Write a line of code that prints the substring "string" from my_string using slicing.
Modify the existing string to replace the word "Printed" with "Output" and then print the updated string.
Write a function called first_and_last_chars that takes a string as an argument and returns a new string consisting of the first and last characters of the input string concatenated together. Use this function to obtain the result for my_string.
